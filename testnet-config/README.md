# How it works
- It is a WIP, not perfect to use on a cron job yet
- Copy paste the column from airtable into airtable raw
- run `ts-node testnet-config/verify-indexers.ts`
- Then send-grt should run and send. But currently I just copy paste the false ones into
  dispearse.app and send in 1 tx. I will streamline it soon
